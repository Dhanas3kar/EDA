## üìù Notebooks

Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific dataset or EDA technique. They include:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.)
- Statistical summaries
- Insights and observations

Refer to the top of each notebook for a summary of its purpose and the dataset it uses.

## üìä Datasets

The repository includes several CSV files for hands-on EDA practice. These datasets cover topics such as stock prices, sports analytics, entertainment, weather, and demographics. You can use them directly in the provided notebooks or for your own analysis.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/Dhanas3kar/EDA.git
	cd EDA
	```
2. **Set up a Python environment:**
	- It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
	  ```sh
	  python -m venv venv
	  venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
	  # or
	  source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
	  ```
3. **Install required packages:**
	- Most notebooks use `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. Install them with:
	  ```sh
	  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
	  ```
4. **Open notebooks:**
	- Use JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code to open and run the `.ipynb` files.
